<h1>Bike Services</h1>
<div class="serviceinfor">
<p>To enhance our servicing, we have improved the choices 
    that our customers can make. We have designed our servicing around your 
    bike, rather than having services that meet the needs of our workshop. We want you 
    to be able to choose exactly the services you need, rather than pay for work that you may
     not require. All of our services include the following:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Free health check for your bicycle <span>&#10003;</span></li>
<li>First class servicing at affordable prices <span>&#10003;</span></li>
   <li>Servicing built around the needs of your bicycle <span>&#10003;</span></li>
   <li>Free expert aftercare advice <span>&#10003;</span> </li>
